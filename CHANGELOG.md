- Defer scheduler switches to the idle loop via a resched flag.
- Add a cooperative yield path for the dummy task.

- Pool early task stacks with a fixed slot limit.
- Add a task table and store task IDs in the run queue.
- Fix cooperative yield to requeue the current task.
- Add a task wait queue with block/wake helpers.
- Add a sleep queue and scheduler-backed sleep helper.
- Add a third dummy task to exercise sleep.
- Gate dummy scheduler tasks and tick logs behind the sched-demo feature.
- Refine block/wake state transitions for wait queues.
- Add a trapframe guard for future preemption.
- Track trapframe pointers in the task table.
- Track wait completion reasons and validate task state transitions.
- Exercise wait queues with notify/timeout dummy tasks.
- Clear stale sleep queue entries after wait completion.
- Add a minimal syscall dispatcher and U-mode ecall handling.
- Add a minimal user-mode mapping and sscratch-based trap stack swap.
- Add minimal user pointer translation and sys_write console output.
- Add a user-test feature flag and USER_TEST=1 smoke validation for U-mode ecall.
- Add UserPtr/UserSlice helpers to validate and copy user buffers.
- Add minimal sys_read for fd=0 using SBI getchar (EAGAIN when no input).
- Make user-mode smoke buffer cross-page to exercise UserSlice chunking.
- Add clock_gettime/gettimeofday/getpid time stubs (MONOTONIC/RAW/BOOTTIME/COARSE).
